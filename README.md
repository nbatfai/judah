# Judah
"The son of Jacob is Judah." In the project called Judah we equip Jacob with a text-based user interface. It is our hope that Jacob (Isaac and Samu) will be the ancestor of developmental robotics chatter bots that will be able to chat in natural language like humans do.

## Genealogy of Judah

1. [Samu](https://github.com/nbatfai/samu)
The main purpose of this project is to allow the evaluation and verification of the results of the paper entitled **"A disembodied developmental robotic agent called Samu Bátfai"**. It is our hope that Samu will be the ancestor of developmental robotics chatter bots that will be able to chat in natural language like humans do.
2. [Isaac](https://github.com/nbatfai/isaac)
*"The son of Samu is Isaac."* The project called Isaac is a case study of using deep Q learning with neural networks for predicting the next sentence of a conversation.
3. [Jacob](https://github.com/nbatfai/jacob)
*"The son of Isaac is Jacob."* The project called Jacob is an experiment to replace Isaac's (GUI based) visual imagination with a character console. 
4. [Judah](https://github.com/nbatfai/judah)
*"The son of Jacob is Judah."* In the project called Judah we equip Jacob with a text-based user interface.
5. [Super-Judah](https://github.com/nbatfai/super-judah)
6. [Perez](https://github.com/nbatfai/perez)
*"The son of Judah is Perez."* The project called Perez allows to perform experiments to test several parameter settings. Here each experiment is implemented as a separate git branch.
7. [Hezron](https://github.com/nbatfai/Hezron)
*"The son of Perez is Hezron."* 

## Use cases

- version 0.0.1.exp.a1, this version is used in the experiment labelled with A1.


# Samu
The purpose of this project is only to allow the evaluation and verification of the results of the paper entitled **"A disembodied developmental robotic agent called Samu Bátfai"**. This paper presents Q learning with neural networks approximators used by Samu. 

It is our hope that Samu will be the ancestor of developmental robotics chatter bots that will be able to chat in natural language like humans do.

## Usage 
The two use cases shown in the paper entitled **"A disembodied developmental robotic agent called Samu Bátfai"** are presented in a YouTube video at

Try another fork of this project in case you want to use Samu as a chat program. The first official fork of Samu, called Isaac, will be public soon. Isaac's repository will be available a https://github.com/nbatfai/isaac
